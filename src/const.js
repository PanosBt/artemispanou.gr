        Working on the branding for Lazaros Flowers, I established a fresh and elegant identity. Launching with a redesigned logo, I chose a color close to Metallic Seaweed for vibrancy.
        <br><br>
        Following that, I crafted business cards and stickers to enhance their overall branding.

            Taking on the design for Pet365, I crafted a modern identity that reflects care and love for pets. Starting with a fresh logo, I used shades of blue and purple to bring vibrancy.

            <br>
            Then, I designed the website, focusing on a clean, user-friendly, and welcoming experience, with soft pastel tones used throughout the platform.
